There are a few frontmatter variables that can be used for all fragments. The
variables are as follows:

#### background
Set the background of the fragment.

Background also affects the text color of the fragment's content.
For the background colors of `white`, `light`, `secondary` and `primary` we use Bootstrap's `text_dark` class on content and for other backgrounds, we use `text_light`.

List of all supported colors can be found in [supported colors](/docs/supported-colors) section of the docs.

#### title
Set title of the fragment

#### subtitle    
Set subtitle of the fragment

#### title_align 
Change alignment of fragment's header

#### padding
*Experimental* 

Changes the padding of fragment's container
