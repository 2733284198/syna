Member fragment can be used to display important people in your team, display
their contact information, a small resume and some description or bio.

This fragment should always be placed in a subdirectory that contains a
definition of the fragment and definition of each item displayed in the
fragment.

Since member fragment can display an image per member, it has support for [image
resource
fallthrough](https://github.com/okkur/syna/blob/master/docs/README.md#image-resource-fallthrough).

There are two modes of showing members supported by members fragment.

- [Single member](#single-member)
- [Multiple members](#members)
