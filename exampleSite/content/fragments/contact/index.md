Contact fragment renders a form with maximum of 4 fields:

- Name
- Email
- Phone
- Message

This fragment supports validations and thus can have customized error messages.
Recaptcha and Netlify (with Netlify auto Recaptcha) support is also enabled. If
you have a [Formspree](https://formspree.io) account you can just enter your
email or if you don't, you can use a custom server or other form submission
handlers.
